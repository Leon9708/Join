            <div class="content_text">A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize
                work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams
                establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to
                help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

            <div class="content_subheadline">History</div>
            <div class="content_text">
                The Japanese word “kanban”, meaning “visual board” or a “sign”, has been used in the sense of a process
                definition since the 1950s. It was first developed and applied by Toyota as a scheduling system for
                just-in-time manufacturing. On the other hand, the capitalized term “Kanban” is known and associated
                with the emergence of the “Kanban Method,” which was first defined in 2007.
